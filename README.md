# Pataka Test - Speech Pathology Analysis Tool

## Overview

The **Pataka Test** is an advanced speech pathology analysis tool designed to assess speech motor control and articulation in individuals with speech disorders. The test focuses on the rapid repetition of the syllable sequence "pa-ta-ka" (also known as the DDK - Diadochokinetic test), which is a standard clinical assessment for evaluating speech motor planning and execution.

## What is the Pataka Test?

The Pataka test is a widely used clinical assessment in speech-language pathology that evaluates:

- **Diadochokinesis**: The ability to rapidly alternate between different articulatory movements
- **Speech Motor Control**: Coordination and timing of speech production
- **Articulation Precision**: Clarity and distinctness of consonant production
- **Speech Rate**: Speed and consistency of syllable production

### Clinical Applications

This test is particularly valuable for assessing:
- **Dysarthria**: Motor speech disorders affecting muscle control
- **Apraxia of Speech**: Difficulty planning and executing speech movements
- **Parkinson's Disease**: Speech motor control issues
- **Stroke Recovery**: Speech motor rehabilitation progress
- **Developmental Speech Disorders**: Childhood speech motor development
